## Overview
This project contains scripts to train a model to recognize text that has been translated using Google Translate.
### Background
In my previous teaching career, I became sadly familiar with a very basic form of plagiarism detection: when a human expert (me, in this case) has reason to believe that a student may have copied text from an uncredited source, a Google search is often enough to figure out where it came from. However, it's not always that easy.  
Someone I'm very close to is a teacher of English to speakers of other languages. Plagiarism detection is more complex in an ESL (English as a second language) environment. What's relevant here is that students may find a text in their first language, translate it into English using Google Translate or some similar service, and then attempt to pass off that translation as their own work. An expert may suspect that this is plagiarism, but finding the original source&mdash;especially when the teacher isn't a strong user of the student's first language&mdash;is non-trivial. I wanted to build a tool that could give some weight to the teacher's judgment that a text may not be the student's original work.
